    "Decorated merge trees can be compared using the decorated bottleneck distance defined in Section 4.5 of [1]. We can estimate this distance using a variant of Gromov-Wasserstein distance called [Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02834). This involves another parameter $\\alpha$, which balances the weight of degree-0 vs. higher degree homology when finding a merge tree interleaving. \n",

    "Details and more examples will be provided in a followup notebook. The basic syntax for computing the distance is shown below. It is computationally beneficial to simplify the merge tree (as above) before computing the distance. This distance computation is currently usable, but is **not yet optimized**---faster versions of this algorithm will be included in future updates to the repository."

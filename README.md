# Decorated-Merge-Trees

Code for creating, manipulating, visualizing and comparing Merge Trees and Decorated Merge Trees (DMTs). Merge trees are a classical tool in the field of topological data analysis (and more broady in data science and computational geometry). DMTs were recently introduced in our paper

This repository will be regularly updated. Currently, the code is not optimized and was mainly developed to create examples for the paper. We will be fixing bugs and adding improvements to the code.

We plan to add notebooks which recreate all of the figures in the paper. Please contact us with questions or to report any issues.
